This directory contains one main notebook, and four practice notebooks. **Toxic Comment Classifier - Keras-TF.ipynb** is the primary work and presentation notebook. The three code-alongs reimplement strong techniques that have proven to do well on the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge competition, and explore NLP in the new PyTorch Torchtext library. The final notebook is an implementation of a [Na√Øve Bayes SVM](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P12-2018) - a linear model using a Term-Document Matrix to classify text data.
